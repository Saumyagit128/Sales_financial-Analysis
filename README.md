## üìä Data Visualization ‚Äì Power BI Dashboards  

### üìÑ Page 1: Sales Performance Overview + Time Series + Geographical  

#### üéØ Purpose: High-level KPIs, revenue, time series, and geographical insights.  

#### üî∏ Visuals:  
- KPI Cards: Revenue, Total Orders, Total Customers, YoY Growth %  
- Revenue by Country (Column Chart)  
- Top 5 Products by Revenue (Column Chart)  
- Donut Charts:  
  - Revenue by Customer Segment

  - Revenue Forecast (2 Years Ahead)  
  - 3-Month Moving Avg (Line Chart)  
- Slicers: Year, Country, Category  
- Page Navigation Enabled

DAX:

    Total Sales = SUM(fact_sales[sales_amount])

    Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(order_number)

YoY Growth using:

    Latest Year = MAX('Date Table'[Year])
    Latest Year Revenue = CALCULATE( [Total Revenue], 'Date Table'[Year] = MAX('Date Table'[Year]))
    Previous Year Revenue = 
    CALCULATE(
        [Total Revenue],
        'Date Table'[Year] = MAX('Date Table'[Year]) - 1
    )

    YoY Growth % = 
    DIVIDE([Latest Year Revenue] - [Previous Year Revenue], [Previous Year Revenue])

Monthly growth using: - 
    
    Previous Month Revenue = 
    CALCULATE(
        [Total Revenue],
        PREVIOUSMONTH('Date Table'[Date]))

    MoM Growth % = 
    IF(NOT ISBLANK([Previous Month Revenue]), DIVIDE([Total Revenue] - [Previous Month Revenue], [Previous Month Revenue], BLANK()))

For Cumulative revenue graph -
    
    Running Total Revenue = 
    CALCULATE(
    [Total Revenue],
    FILTER(
        ALLSELECTED('Date Table'[Date]),
        'Date Table'[Date] <= MAX('Date Table'[Date])
        )
    )
    

For 3- month moving avg -

    3-Month Moving Avg = 
    AVERAGEX(
    DATESINPERIOD(
        'Date Table'[Date],
        MAX('Date Table'[Date]),
        -3,
        MONTH
        ), [Total Revenue]
    )
